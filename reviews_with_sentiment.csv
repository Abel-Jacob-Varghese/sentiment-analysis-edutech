162,karen samuel,10-07-2024,Jul-24,LuminarTechnolab,1,Data science,"This is a genuine review unlike the fake positive ones you saw. I joined Luminar on 2023 and took bigdata data science course. The course took 1 year to complete and you may wonder how. The promised time of completion of course was 7 months. The classes are only 1 hour 30 minutes in which 20 minutes will go for taking attendance online and offline making it only around 1 hour daily. Imagine 1 hour spent daily for an entire one year.. Now coming to the syllabus... They will teach only the introduction and rest of them we have to study by our own which i did. But things become worse when the course was about to end. No placements for students. They promised placement support but they doesn't keep their word. Overall i got 2 interviews from them in which one is unpaid and other is unpaid for 3 months and 10k per month. Most of the companies they give us for attending interviews are startups and majority won't give us salary. Now you will see some negative reviews and many positive reviews also. But i must say the positive ones are forced by the management and you may not get placement if you post negatively. That's why even i am posting this review in a fake account . The owners are greedy and they don't provide placement support for the students. 75% of placements you see them posting on social media are not done by them rather by the students itself.

Unfortunately, even after successfully completing the training, they are still struggling to find a job and are left chasing HR teams, referrals, and walk-in interviewsopportunities they could have pursued without Techmindzs help.The expectation from Techmindz was proper placement support, as assured during the enrollment process. However, the lack of real assistance has caused a lot of stress and disappointment for both the candidates and their families. The mental pressure of this situation is affecting them deeply.I sincerely urge Techmindz to honor their commitment and genuinely support students in securing jobs.

852,Nidheesh Omanakuttan,06-09-2024,Sep-24,BrototypeKochi,4,"Mern Stack, React","I am Nidheesh O, was a student at Brototype a few months before. Currently I am working as a React Developer (MERN STACK) at Blusteak Media in kottayam. I joined Brototype after a rejecting the offer letter from Infosys. I completed  graduation in 2022 in BBA with Computer Application. Since I don't have any interest in working as a Process Executive Role at Infosys, I planned to switch my career & ended up here in Brototype at kochi (Maradu). I started as a trial and I failed to complete the entry test called fumigation in the first attempt I tried again & successfully completed fumigation. After fumigation, i felt bit happy as well as bit scared of how it's going to be because I heared so many unwanted things like my batchmates quits after fumigation and switch to Luminar, like all things are going around & to be honest I also enquired about Luminar after fumigation but my mind & the way learning and discussion all the things including communication session & fun activities all mix up are only in Brototype, that's main difference between Brototype & other Boot camps. Fumigation rounds literally boosted my confidence as well my mindset is like Definitely I'm going to complete this course in 7 months period. There were many hardships in between as part of learning and also some personal issues but the motivation from my friends and the advisors made me continue with the same energy throughout course. The day I hosted my first project felt like a great achievement and I feel so proud of myself and parents are happy, everyone in my batchmates as well. After the first project, I felt like a professional Developer and these things level up my motivation to do more and learn new things & finally React comes into picture, one of my favorite learning weeks after data structure is React, because I'm very curious about it & I know the most of the things we can create using react website. After the react week over we have to attend a full domain week,this is interesting part in my Brototype career, glad I just takes 2 weeks to crack out the Full domain. After this we enter into our second project with react and it is bit easy compare to our first project first 2 weeks i struggled a lot then gradually get the momentum to complete the projects on time.Here after the completion of second project, we have Boarding week, this phase we have recover all the things we have studied in the past 24 weeks and we have to crack two boarding weeks to enter into TOI. But for me i have bit trouble in cracking the boarding weeks beacuse I'm focused on attending the interviews and completing machine test so I'm not able to focus on boarding week and before entering into my second boarding week i got placed in a Company, I'm really happy because I have reached this far without depending too much on my Batchmates.I want to say one is if you have patience to land in a great company u have to focus more on passing the TOI that comes after boarding week 1 & 2. In boarding week 1&2 they provide so many ways to improve and crack the any interview in a single attempt. So I want to thank all the communication trainers for improving my skills even more to crack all these interviews in an attempt.They provide everything to learn and be successful in our life the only thing is we should invest our time and dedication. Overall, being at Brocamp was a milestone in my life and if you guys want a break in your career, my suggestion would be Brototype.",i am nidheesh o was a student at brototype a few months before currently i am working as a react developer mern stack at blusteak media in kottayam i joined brototype after a rejecting the offer letter from infosys i completed graduation in 2022 in bba with computer application since i dont have any interest in working as a process executive role at infosys i planned to switch my career ended up here in brototype at kochi maradu i started as a trial and i failed to complete the entry test called fumigation in the first attempt i tried again successfully completed fumigation after fumigation i felt bit happy as well as bit scared of how its going to be because i heared so many unwanted things like my batchmates quits after fumigation and switch to luminar like all things are going around to be honest i also enquired about luminar after fumigation but my mind the way learning and discussion all the things including communication session fun activities all mix up are only in brototype thats main difference between brototype other boot camps fumigation rounds literally boosted my confidence as well my mindset is like definitely im going to complete this course in 7 months period there were many hardships in between as part of learning and also some personal issues but the motivation from my friends and the advisors made me continue with the same energy throughout course the day i hosted my first project felt like a great achievement and i feel so proud of myself and parents are happy everyone in my batchmates as well after the first project i felt like a professional developer and these things level up my motivation to do more and learn new things finally react comes into picture one of my favorite learning weeks after data structure is react because im very curious about it i know the most of the things we can create using react website after the react week over we have to attend a full domain weekthis is interesting part in my brototype career glad i just takes 2 weeks to crack out the full domain after this we enter into our second project with react and it is bit easy compare to our first project first 2 weeks i struggled a lot then gradually get the momentum to complete the projects on timehere after the completion of second project we have boarding week this phase we have recover all the things we have studied in the past 24 weeks and we have to crack two boarding weeks to enter into toi but for me i have bit trouble in cracking the boarding weeks beacuse im focused on attending the interviews and completing machine test so im not able to focus on boarding week and before entering into my second boarding week i got placed in a company im really happy because i have reached this far without depending too much on my batchmatesi want to say one is if you have patience to land in a great company u have to focus more on passing the toi that comes after boarding week 1 2 in boarding week 12 they provide so many ways to improve and crack the any interview in a single attempt so i want to thank all the communication trainers for improving my skills even more to crack all these interviews in an attemptthey provide everything to learn and be successful in our life the only thing is we should invest our time and dedication overall being at brocamp was a milestone in my life and if you guys want a break in your career my suggestion would be brototype,TRUE,0.251998819,0.523221173,Positive,Positive,IT Training Center,MERN Stack
